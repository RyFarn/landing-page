# landing-page

This is a first try at creating a web homepage using the information I have learnt so far.
I am looking forward to trying out new concepts, reinforcing existing ones, and hopefully learning a lot along the way. In this instance, I am going to create a website homepage for a cleaning company in the Auckland area. This should allow me to test my skills, while also serving as a potential template to use one day as a legitimate business.
